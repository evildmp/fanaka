How to write things down
========================

..  rubric:: A technique for note-taking for job-seekers


Writing things down is *good*.

There will be things that you want to remember, say and ask about, and taking the trouble to write them down will help ensure that in the right moment, you actually do.

But, there is a particular way of writing things down that can make them much more effective.


Notes and sentences
===================

First write them as short notes.

Then write them again, *putting them into sentences*.

There is real power and value in doing this. The reality is that you will look at a note you quickly scribbled down, and in your mind, it will represent a fully-formed thought. What you will discover, when you need to express it properly, in a real live situation, is that the effective expression of it eludes you. It will come out broken and weak.

Instead if you write it out as a full sentence, you'll have that in your mind and on paper too.

Quite likely, that exact sentence won't be the exact one you need when the time comes - but it will be far easier to shift from that to another fluent expression of the idea that it will be to make it come to life from short notes.

Yes, it takes a lot longer to do it this way, but the first time you need to reach for a sentence, and find it there ready to hand - whether in your mind or on the page - you will be grateful.

Writing things down like this is a form of *practice*, rehearsal that makes you good at it.
